## Idea for overlapped peak detection

# key question I am going to ask from R-Studio

1. I gave the peak regions information to let know R that this my input; I also give target reference gene' regions to IntervalTree;

Question 1: ask R to bring me back overlapped peak regions based on my input peak regions from target gene' regions
Question 2: once R report overlapped regions of the peak; I further ask to R which peak overlapped, which chromosome they are come from,
            what's these overlapped peak' pvalue; 
            
Question 3: pending the question !!
