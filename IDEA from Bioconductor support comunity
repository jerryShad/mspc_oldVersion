## IDEA from bioconductor support community

# consider 2 GRanges objects

anyHits <- findOverlaps(gr2, gr1)
withinHits <- findOverlaps(gr2, gr1, type="within")
setdiff(anyHits, withinHits)


## call findOverlap() from GenomicRanges packages
hits <- findOverlaps(query, subject, ...)
overlap <- pintersect(query[queryHits(hits)],
                      subject[subjectHits(hits)])
                      
width(overlap)


## Question: Quantifying peaks corresponding to a purticular feature
## Answer: A possible solution is define the genomic region as a GRanges object and use the findOverlaps from GenomicFeatures package
##          to get the peaks that overlap with the genomic region. Then you can count the number of peaks.
