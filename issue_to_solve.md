## MSPC project

summary of MSPC project:

step 1: load gene replicate in R is done; read all peak fron source gene replicate is done; peak classification for each peak is done;

## How to improve and refine the R function

1. for each gene replicate, split the whole sequence to each chromosome; make R code can access the peak by chromosome
